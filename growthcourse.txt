Hey! Thank you SO much for purchasing this little course i've written out.

You've bought this because you want a minimum of 500-1000 followers per DAY, so follow my EVERY step.

If you haven't bought this course, YOU ARE COMMITTING A ROBBERY, AND I WILL FIND YOUR ASS. So DM me @REDDITWRLD on 
instagram for pricing.

IF YOU NEED ANY HELP AT ALL, DM @REDDITWRLD ON INSTAGRAM, I'LL BE HAPPY TO HELP (unless you didn't buy this course, 
then i'll kill you)

A few things before we start..
1. This can all be done on your phone, but it is recommended by me that you have a computer.
2. You won't need any paid software or hardware to do this, everything you will need is now completely free.
3. This method isn't entirely a sit-back and relax thing, unless your simply watching followers roll in.
4. This method works for every type of account and isn't restricted to just meme accounts.
5. I should've sent you a video to watch for step 7, if i haven't, DM me now (@REDDITWRLD)
6. Don't be scared of how long this process is, it's actually a relatively simple concept!

Ok, lets get started, shall we?

Step 1:

- If you haven't already, create a private instagram account you will be growing
- In the bio, include the line 'if i accept in 5 sec you have to stay followed" , this increases the rate at 
which people decide not to unfollow

Step 2: (You can either use your phone or computer for this step): 

- Open your browser and type 'http://auto-acceptor.radleygreenwell.repl.run/' into the URL box. This should open a black screen with white
text. Wait for the initial steps of the program to finish, and it should ask you to login to instagram.

- If you feel skeptical about typing in your credentials, understand that the source code has been examined by 
myself as well as other large pages that use this. If you're still skeptical, feel free to read the source code
yourself here: https://repl.it/@instagram/Follow-request-accepter
- After you type in your credentials, the program should display 'Followers accepted: 0" , this is where the 
program will display all follow requests it accepts (instantly of course).
- This tab in your browser MUST REMAIN OPEN otherwise the program will end.
- On mobile, you may leave the browser as long as it is still running in the background.
- NOTICE: On mobile, you HAVE to keep your phone ON, otherwise the bot will shut down, see steps 10 and 11 for an
EFFICIENT workaround.

- NOTICE: the program will oddly shut down BY ITSELF after an hour or so of being active, all you have to do is
click/press "run again" which will display at the bottom of the screen. This will hopefully be patched in future
versions.

Step 3 (this step will take a bit of manual work): 

- On your instagram page, follow everyone my account (@RedditWRLD) is following. You may receive an action block if 
you follow too many at one time. I suggest you follow 25-75 accounts every few hours to avoid this. 
- These accounts you just followed contain a large following and engagement rate, and will be needed when 
self-promoting.

Step 4 (setting up text replacement):

- Now we'll set up your self-promoting lines.
- These will be the comments you will post on the accounts on your feed as they come
- On your iPhone (for android go to https://www.wikihow.com/Add-Custom-Text-Shortcuts-to-Android) go to 
Settings > General > Keyboard > Text Replacement. Press the plus sign in the top right corner to add a new
shortcut.
- You will be adding 4 different shortcuts.
- You should place an emoji of your choice in place of the underscores!!!
- The shortcuts need to be as follows:
	1. Phrase = *hand pointing left emoji* request and refresh!
	   Shortcut = qq
	2. Phrase = i accept in under 5 sec , i have NEVER failed __
	   Shortcut = qqq
	3. Phrase = If i accept under 5 sec you have to like this __
	   Shortcut = xx
	4. Phrase = if i accept in 5 seconds you have to like this comment __
           Shortcut = xxx
- These 4 shortcuts will allow you to comment much faster than copying comments and pasting them from your notes.
- These 4 shortcuts are also GUARANTEED to work, however, feel free to make up your own persuading comments.
- REFER TO THE IMAGE SENT TO YOU OVER EMAIL! 
- If you are unable to get these phrases on to your phone for whatever reason, DM @RedditWRLD on instagram and I 
will gladly send mine to you! :)
- Your shortcuts are now set up and you're ready to start gaining followers!

Step 5 (this step makes sure you're ready to start promoting):

- Make sure your auto acceptor is still running in the background of your browser
- You will know if the acceptor is working if it displays a blue square loading animation to the left of the 
words "Followers accepted:"
- You should be following at least 200 accounts at this point, if not, take some time to follow more accounts that
my account follows (@RedditWRLD).
- Remember that the more accounts you follow, the better

Step 6 (learning how to use text replacement):

- Open your notes (on Android, just go somewhere that allows you to type, ex. instagram DMs)
- Open a new note
- In this note, you will find that when you type 'xx' , the phrase you placed earlier will appear in the center
top of your keyboard. 
- Simply press the phrase, and it will replace the two X's. 
- Mastering this skill is imperative when self-promoting as it is 2-3 times faster than copying and pasting
- Practice this with the other shortcuts (xxx, qq, qqq) until you believe you understand it
- DM ME IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS STEP (@RedditWRLD)

Step 7 (time to comment!):

- Open instagram on the account you wish to grow and go to your home feed.
- You should notice that after refreshing the home page multiple times, a few new posts should show up
- THE GOAL OF SELF PROMOTING IS TO BE THE FIRST PERSON TO COMMENT ON A NEW POST
- Your job now, is to sit on the home feed, refresh the page over and over until new posts show up.
- instantly, you need to use text replacement on the comment section of the post to be the first person to 
comment
- REFER TO THE VIDEO SENT TO YOU OVER EMAIL FOR A TUTORIAL (VERY HELPFUL)!
- You should use the 4 shortcuts randomely when commenting on new posts to avoid action bans

DO NOT:
- Comment more than once per post
- Comment on posts exactly as they appear, skip a post or two to avoid action bans
- Comment more than 5-7 times per minute
- Comment if other self-promoters are in the comment section before you

Step 8 (satisfaction):

- You will notice after a few comments (if you were first) than your acceptor bot will skyrocket in numbers
as followers roll in
- You will also notice that followers will be accepted INSTANTLY AUTOMATICALLY as long as the bot is running
- Remember to restart the bot when it shuts down, normally once per hour.
- Repeat step 7 multiple times daily for a constant high follower income.
- This is a very addicting process at times, and you must avoid commenting too many times too fast.
- The faster you comment, the more followers you'll gain! However, don't comment too fast or you'll receive an
action ban (NOT fun). 
- Feel free to manipulate this process to your liking, however DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS FILE!

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

These next few steps are optional, and much more complicated, but important if you would like to keep your acceptor
bot alive for a longer period.

YOU MUST HAVE A PERSONAL COMPUTER FOR THESE NEXT STEPS!

Step 9 (setting up your computer for remote access):

- If not already installed, install google chrome on your computer (available here: https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAiA_f3uBRAmEiwAzPuaM5PMjGcTrb2ulkycZD9JlmNV1jc-3htkHZ-XIFkrJfbdbiTDsmho2RoCgbAQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds 
- Install the google chrome remote desktop extension on your computer (available here: https://remotedesktop.google.com/access/ 
- On your phone, install 'Chrome Remote Desktop' from the appstore
- On your phone and computer, follow the steps necessary to set up these programs on both your phone and computer
- If your having difficulties setting it up, here are a few tutorials:

	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTiGI_amQpg
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeit8aDlYho <- most helpful

Step 10 (setting up your computer con't):

- You should now know how to remotely access google chrome.
- If you for some reason have no idea what you're doing, DM me (@REDDITWRLD) OR see the above tutorials
- Open google chrome on your computer
- Create a new tab with the acceptor bot RUNNING
- Plug your charger into the computer so it doesn't die while running the bot
- Place your computer in a safe place (IT HAS TO BE OPEN)
- On your computer, open battery saver settings and TURN OFF AUTO SLEEP

Step 11 (accessing your computer from somewhere else):

- You may now USE YOUR PHONE to access your computer from a different location.
- You should be able to connect to your computer through your phone, including your acceptor bot
- From here, you are now able to RESTART the bot from your phone when it has shut down on your computer.

- You may be wondering why you would want to access your acceptor bot remotely:

- PROS:
	1. Restart your bot at any time from anywhere in like 30 seconds 
	2. You don't have to keep your phone on at all times to keep the bot alive
- CONS:
	1. You have to keep your computer on and running at all times from your home
	2. No other cons lmao 

IF YOU NEED ANY HELP WITH THESE OPTIONAL STEPS, EITHER REREAD THE STEPS OR DM ME (@RedditWRLD)
